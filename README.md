Just walked out and holy crap, Revelations is like trying to piece together a shattered mirror while you're roller-skating through a haunted funhouse. I'm still dizzy af. The theater was echoing like a metal concert, popcorn kernels crunching under my feet, and someone's toddler belting out a random Mariah high note. Couldn't even feel my back halfway through, but maybe that's my fault for sitting in those relics they call seats.

> The scenes – I mean, one moment you’re plunged into this deep, midnight blue sea of quiet, and then BAM! that insane explosion of lights and noise and it's like you're inside a kaleidoscope laced with electric eels. Was anybody else clutching their seat like it was a lifeline, or was that just me? The director has to be some mad wizard, I'm telling you.

And dude, that one part, with the girl standing at the edge of the universe like she's hosting a cosmic cocktail party – it made me think of my aunt Carol and her over-the-top Christmas decorations. Stars? You ain’t got nothing on her twinkling reindeer.

I don’t even know how to describe the plot – it’s like trying to explain the sound of purple. But when that character – you know the one – turned around and said that thing, I swear I got goosebumps like when you drop your croissant and catch it just before it hits the floor.

Ah, was supposed to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or was it 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 – totally forgot, someone mentioned it during the second act when I think someone spilled their soda behind me, sticky feet after that. Anyway, I’m rambling. Just GO 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, or swim in it, whatever suits the mood.

function doSomethingWeird() {
    var thought = “undefined”;
    console.log(thought  mystery); // There’s no spoon.
